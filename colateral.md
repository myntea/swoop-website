  - title: COMPLIANCE STANDARDS.

By using <strong>co.lateral</strong> each step and action in the process is captured and each comment logged. Importantly all the data is easily and readily available.
  - title: REPORTING & ANALYSIS.
    description: By breaking down complex organisational structures and processes into manageable steps and actions, and presenting detail in a simple, easy to use way, <strong>co.lateral</strong> will provide transparency and visibility of actions throughout your organisation. The technology is designed to report on, and analyse different elements of the workflow, and provide data and information in easy to interpret reports.
